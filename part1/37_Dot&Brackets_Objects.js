// difference between dot and bracket notaion

// using Brackets, we can access those keys whose name has spaces. This is not possbile using dots.

// const key = "email";
// const person = {
//     name: "harshit",
//     age: 22,
//     "person hobbies": ["guitar", "sleeping", "listening music"]

// }

// console.log(person["person hobbies"]);
// person[key] = "harshitvashisth@gmail.com"; --->> By this method we can make the value of a variable(i.e email) as the key of an object. 
    The step wise functioning of this method i.e. square brackets w/o inv commas is as follows:
      person[key] => person["email"] => gauravmishra193@gmail.com
// console.log(person);
