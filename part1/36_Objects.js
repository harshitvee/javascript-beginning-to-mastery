// objects reference type  
// arrays are good but not sufficient 
// for real world data 
// objects store key value pairs 
// objects don't have index

// how to create objects 

// const person = {name:"Harshit",age:22};--->> here name is key and harshit is its value. Similarly age and 22.
// when array is declared in this way i.e using curly braces and all, then it is called object Literals.
const person = {
    name: "harshit",
    age: 22,
    hobbies: ["guitar", "sleeping", "listening music"]--->> // object can store an array also
}

// Accesing the data of an object is done using dots.
    console.log(person.name);
// Accesing the data of an object is done using square brackets.
    console.log(person["name"] // double invCommas are used because in objects the keys are by default stored as string only.

   
// how to access data from objects 
// console.log(person["name"]);
// console.log(person["age"]);
// console.log(person.hobbies);

// how to add key value pair to objects using dots.
person.gender="male" // now another key value pair has been added in the object Person.
// how to add key value pair to objects using square brackets.
    person{[]
person["person"] = "male";
console.log(person);
